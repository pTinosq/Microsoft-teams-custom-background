# Information and warnings

- This will not work for Linux/Mac OS systems. **Windows only!**

- All changes made in the software are irreversible from inside the program. There are warnings when you're about to make a big change but do be careful with what you do. For example, don't upload a folder with 1000000 text files, this will just ruin your computer.

- The exe file in the build folder is actually a shortcut so you can place it anywhere on your computer

- To find your Microsoft Teams Upload Folder hold the Windows Key and press r. Then type %appdata% in the dialog that pops up. Once you've done that, go to Microsoft/Teams/Backgrounds/Uploads and you'll find your images in there.
